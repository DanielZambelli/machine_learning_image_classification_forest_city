# Image classification and prediction using Tensorflow and Python
Setup for simple image classification and prediction as an alternative to more costly cloud providers.

## Commands
* Train model using data: `python3 app.py train`  
* Make image prediction: `python3 app.py predict [img_src]` e.g. ./data-test/city/img1.jpg  
* List model labels: `python3 app.py labels`  

## Tech stack
* Python version 3.8.6
* Tensorflow version 2.3.1
